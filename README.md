# 🌞 Solaris

**Solaris** is a machine learning project that predicts solar power output using **multimodal data**, including time series, tabular sensor data, and potentially vision data (e.g., sky images).

The goal is to build accurate and scalable models to forecast solar energy production for better energy planning and management.

## 📌 Features

- Load and preprocess solar plant data
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models
- Compare model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R²
- Visualize results with plots and metrics dashboards
